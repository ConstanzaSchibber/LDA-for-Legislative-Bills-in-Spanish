# LDA-for-Legislative-Bills-in-Spanish

I have applied a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to uncover the topic of over 10,000 bills introduced by legislators in the lower chamber of Argentina between 2000 and 2007. I relied on the text in which legislators explain the purpose of the bill to uncover the mixture of topics. I downloaded the bills - along with information of the sporsor of each bill - from the official website. Following the same steps I also uncovered the topics of 18,000 bills introduced by legislators in the Brazilian lower chamber. This is preliminary work for future research.
